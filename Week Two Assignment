Holla. This is what the second sentence a one hundred word entry on email and DNS looks like. I haven't figured out any other sentences yet but that is fine. Something in my gut says this is more about us familiarizing ourselves with GitHub. The most important take away I got from last weeks lecture was how to go about decrypting emails in Gmail. Not that I have need for it now but I definitely will be using such an implement in the future if I need to send possible proprietary information through an email service or to someone using such a service.
